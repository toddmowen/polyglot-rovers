Initial impressions of Scala, based on quite a bit of reading and only a little bit of playing with the REPL:

Scala seems like a very *rich* language. That's not necessarily a barrier to entry, as one can still write code in a simple Java style with classes, methods and imperative statements. But beyond that, Scala offers many more features, starting of course with functional programming, and also the frequently noted sophistication of the type system.

My other first impression, purely aesthetic, is that I find the syntax rather ugly. It doesn't seem as elegant as Haskell (probably because it has to be functional and imperative all at the same time), and I really don't see why Scala needs to invent so many bewildering symbols ('<-', '=>', '!!', '<:', etc) instead of using a few well-chosen keywords. But having said that, I'm going to try to put that prejudice aside (just like anyone wanting to appreciate the beauty of LISP needs to temporarily suspend any distaste they might have for nested parentheses).
